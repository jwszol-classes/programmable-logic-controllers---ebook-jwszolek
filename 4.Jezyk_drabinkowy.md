## Introduction
Ladder Diagram, abbreviated LD, is a widely used language in PLCs. It has a form similar to electrical diagrams, in which a circuit closes between two power lines to create the rungs from which it takes its name. The next rungs of the ladder are the next lines of code. This format was intended to reconcile the need for programming with an easy and accessible interface for electricians. Historically, automation has been implemented by control cabinets consisting of multiple relays, coils, contactors and other simple electrical components. The introduction of programmable logic controllers revolutionised the approach to automation, replacing entire cabinets with one small device. Electricians were responsible for wiring and automation, fitting relays according to schematics, so programming the newly introduced controllers was not possible. PLC manufacturers, given the fact that they had to convince electricians to use controllers, decided to create a graphical programming language that resembled electrical diagrams, with its logic directly related to the operation of electrical circuits.
## Programme organisation
Except when using instructions from the Program Flow group, the program is executed by the driver from left to right and from top to bottom. The programme structure consists of branches and rungs. The programme rung is the connection of the left and right vertical lines symbolising the current flow in relay circuits containing or not containing inputs, outputs, function blocks or other elements in ladder programmes. You can put as many numbers of rungs as per your project requirements.

For writing the program, Inputs and outputs are playing the most important role.
- Inputs refer to the switch or Push Button (PB).
- Output referred to the Coil or Lamp or Load.

Inputs are designated as: -| |- .In the middle of this designation various symbols may appear to indicate different modes of operation of the input.

Outputs are designed as: -( )- . Sometimes it is possible to see a circle instead of brackets. In the middle of this designation various symbols may appear to indicate different modes of operation of the output.
## Construction of rungs
Rungs are horizontal lines in a ladder diagram, each one representing a unique parallel circuit branch between the poles of the power supply. LD programming is based on several principles for constructing the rungs outlined below:
1. Inputs can be used in series (I2, I3, I4) as well as parallel (I1, I2) to form a connection. In the program, AND gate follows the series connections and OR gate follows the parallel connection. Outputs (Q1, Q2, Q3) can only be used in parallel.

2. One input can be used multiple times in one program, but one output cannot, except in Set/Reset and Latch/ Unlatch functions.
3. Input address cannot be used as an output address.
4. Outputs address can be used as inputs address.
5. The last column of the rung may contain an output or function block.

## Data and variables
Numerical data format
- BIT - occupies the smallest memory cell. It has values of 1 or 0.
- BYTE - consists of 8 bits. The range is 0 to 255 (in hexadecimal 0 - FF).
- WORD - occupies 16 consecutive bits of the controller's memory. They cannot be individually addressed. It can store values from 0 - 65 535.
- BCD-4 - four-digit decimal numbers in BCD format, occupies 16 bits of memory. Each digit of this number is encoded in 4 bits and can represent a digit from 0 to 9. The value range is 0 - 9999.
- REAL - real numbers occupy two consecutive memory cells of 16 bits each. The range of values is +-1.401298E-45 to +-3.402823E+38.
- INT - a positive or negative double precision integer. Represented in two's complement notation. The 32nd bit is the sign bit (0 positive, 1 negative). Range -2 147 483 648 to +2 147 483 647.

Register variables (16-bit)
- %AI - analogue input register. The symbol should contain the address of the register, e.g. %AI0001.
- %AQ - analogue output register. The symbol should contain the address of the register.
- %R - a register in which program data is stored, e.g. calculation results. The symbol should contain the address of the register.

Discrete variables (1-bit)
- %I - physical discrete input. Values are placed in the input status table. The symbol should contain the address of the variable, e.g. %I00345. The current state of all inputs of the controller is stored in this array.
- %Q - physical discrete output. The values of the variables are placed in the output status table. The symbol should contain the address of the variable. The array stores the current state of all outputs of the controller. If the variable %Q is assigned to a relay with memory, it will retain its value when the power is switched on again. If the relay is without memory, the value will reset to zero when switched off.
- %M - an internal discrete variable of the control program. This variable can only have state memory if it is assigned to a relay with memory.
- %T - momentary discrete variable, it cannot use the status memory. When the controller is switched off, its value is always set to 0.
- %S - system variables. They allow access to system data, e.g. information on controller operating errors and the operation of input-output modules. There are four types designated %S, %SA, %SB, %SC.
- %G - global variables allowing access to data common to several controllers. These variables always have a state memory, they cannot be assigned to relays without a memory.
## Contacts and relays

## Rules for using function blocks
Each line reaching the left side of a function block represents the input of that function. These may be constant or variable. The constant appears in explicit form, while the variable is identified by its address. The lines coming from the right side of the block represent its output - a variable (it cannot be a constant).
1. If a function block exists in a rung, there must be no branches above or below it
![image](https://github.com/jwszol-classes/programmable-logic-controllers---ebook-jwszolek/assets/106549878/7e275ca7-8f8f-45d2-9774-f8d2bdebe8a6)

2. If there is a function block in the rung, there must be no branches other than those leading straight to the relay coils

3. There must be no contacts after the function block

## Timers and counters
**TIME RELAYS**

Timing relays are divided into relays with and without memory. The first one counts the time when a signal reaches it and retains the counted value when the signal stops arriving. When the signal arrives again, the timer continues. In the case of a relay without memory, the value is reset to zero when the signal disappears and when it returns, the time is counted from the beginning.

**With memory:**
![image](https://github.com/jwszol-classes/programmable-logic-controllers---ebook-jwszolek/assets/106549878/0f99b08c-3aa8-458e-a0ab-cab0c2dc5470)

**Without memory:**
![image](https://github.com/jwszol-classes/programmable-logic-controllers---ebook-jwszolek/assets/106549878/901b5fc7-d2da-4c79-b0db-7a4af8527949)

**Timers parameters:**

- **address:** starting address of the working area in the controller memory, where the current value of the counted time, the set value and the control word are stored. These addresses should not be used by other function blocks. The area occupies three consecutive memory words. The parameter can be of type %R.
- **enable:** input signal that starts the time counting function. For a relay without memory, when this signal stops flowing, the output signal is turned off and the current value is reset to zero.
- **R:** signal resetting the current value (the parameter does not exist in the relay without memory)
- **PV:** the setpoint that is copied from the PV input to the second register when the relay is reset or activated. The parameter cannot be a signal or have type %S.
- **Q:** The output signal appears when the current value is greater than or equal to the set value.

**COUNTERS** 
The counters are divided into those counting up to the set value and those counting down from the set value. The counter range is from 0 to +32767 pulses, for a down counter the lower limit is -32767 pulses.

**COUNTING - UP**
![image](https://github.com/jwszol-classes/programmable-logic-controllers---ebook-jwszolek/assets/106549878/1effe7c8-6be6-4097-9a04-58dc885eafb1)
Applying a signal to the reset input causes the current counter value to be set to 0. Changing the input state from 0 to 1 will increase the current value by 1. This value can be increased above the set value, but after it equals and exceeds the set value, a signal is sent to the output.

**COUNTING - DOWN**
![image](https://github.com/jwszol-classes/programmable-logic-controllers---ebook-jwszolek/assets/106549878/a89398f5-61d4-4b75-bca3-b95f75f23f1f)
Applying a signal to the reset input causes the current counter value to be set to 0. Changing the input state from 0 to 1 will reduce the current value by 1. When the value reaches and exceeds 0, a signal is sent to the output.

**Counters parameters:**

- **address:** starting address of the working area in the controller memory, where the current value of the counted time, the set value and the control word are stored. These addresses should not be used by other function blocks - otherwise these functions will function incorrectly. The area occupies three consecutive memory words.
- **enable:** input signal. Each rising edge of the input signal increases/decreases the current counter value by 1.
- **R:** signal that resets the current value or, in the case of a down counter, sets it to the set value.
- **PV:** sets value copied from the PV input to the second register when the counter is reset or started.
- **Q:** output drive, appearing when the current value is greater than or equal to the set value, or in the case of a down counter, when it is equal to or less than 0.

The parameter types correspond to the relay parameter types.

## Mathematical functions
All mathematical operations are performed using blocks that are characterised by one or two input values, always of integer or double- integer type, as shown in the table below.

![image](https://github.com/jwszol-classes/programmable-logic-controllers---ebook-jwszolek/assets/106549878/73956721-7066-4c71-9373-450017d6bbef)

The above functions, both in ladder diagram software and the previous ones, are represented by functional blocks. Below is an example block for the sum function ADD:

![image](https://github.com/jwszol-classes/programmable-logic-controllers---ebook-jwszolek/assets/106549878/e399d2e1-fc46-4b59-a3e4-9e8523a98765)

Correct execution of the function (i.e. when there is no overflow error - overflow) causes the result of the operation to be sent to the Q output and the current to the output will appear, which will allow it to continue checking the circuit located to the right of the function. No current at the W output indicates an overflow or an attempt to divide by zero (for DIV divider function). The function will be executed when current is supplied to the input of the block.

## Bit operations
The group of operations on bit strings includes logical functions such as negation, logical multiplication and addition, moving and rotating for bit strings, testing bit values, and resetting and setting bits. Basically, these operations are performed on WORD data. Some of them can also be performed on strings of words with a permissible length of up to 256 words. Then the parameter of the function is LEN (length), which specifies the number of words for which the operation should be performed.

**Bit Operation Functions:** 

- AND - logical product
- OR - logical sum
- XOR - logical sum modulo 2
- NOT - negation
- SHL - bit shift to the left
- SHR - bit shift to the right
- ROL - cyclic offset of bits to the left
- ROR - cyclic bit shift to the right
- BIT_SET - sets the value 1 for selected bits in the string
- BIT_CLR - sets the value 0 for selected bits in the string
- BIT_TEST - checks the value of the selected bit in the string
- BIT_POS - checks the position of the first non-zero bit in the string

**Example of the AND function:**
In the example below, each change of the value of %10001 to 1 causes a logical operation to be performed on two 16-bit parameters with the auxiliary names Word1 and Word2. The result of the AND function is written to the RESULT output parameter.

![image](https://github.com/jwszol-classes/programmable-logic-controllers---ebook-jwszolek/assets/106549878/7df24e69-3409-4513-8fa3-8402524ef0c4)

**Example of ROL function:**
In the example below, every time the value of the variable %10001 is changed to 1, the result of the operation to shift bit string %R0001 to the right, in a closed loop, by 3 bits, is written to the output bit string %R0002. The result of the function is written to the output string %R0002. As a result of the function, the input bit string %R0001 is not changed. If the addresses of IN and Q are the same, the input bit string is changed.

![image](https://github.com/jwszol-classes/programmable-logic-controllers---ebook-jwszolek/assets/106549878/5af18806-9a90-4139-8d30-2b48177ded91)

Other logical functions can be implemented in a similar manner to the above examples.

## Data operations
These operations allow data processing, management and communication with other devices, which is crucial for controlling and automating industrial processes.

**Data operation functions in LD:** 

- MOVE - moves the source value to the destination location
- BLKCLR - resets a specific controller memory block
- BLKMOV - simply overlays data from one area to another
- SHFR - shifts the data in register towards the right
- BITSEQ - generates sequences through a series of bits
- COMMREQ - allows the program to communicate with a GE Fanuc intelligent module

**MOVE function**

![image](https://github.com/jwszol-classes/programmable-logic-controllers---ebook-jwszolek/assets/106549878/fce1705d-4be7-46f5-ab4c-6116c9e73eae)

The MOVE function is used to move data (as single bits) from a specific memory location to another. Because the data is transmitted as bits, the new address does not have to correspond to the same data type as the original address.

The MOVE function has two input parameters and two output parameters. When an input signal enters the function block, the data is copied bit by bit from the memory location specified by the IN parameter to the location specified by the Q parameter. The original data is not changed unless the address ranges of the input and output parameters coincide.

**BLKCLR function**

![image](https://github.com/jwszol-classes/programmable-logic-controllers---ebook-jwszolek/assets/106549878/67fc4205-04c3-4d91-a21e-188afb0e14b9)

The BLKCLR function resets a specific controller memory block. It has two input parameters (IN and enable) and one output parameter. When an input signal is received into the function block, all bits of the memory area of the len length starting with the address specified by the IN parameter are reset.

## Array operations
From the functions of searching data arrays, we can distinguish operations: 
1. **ARRAY_MOVE**, which allows you to copy a certain number of data from the source array to the destination
2. **SRCH**, which allows you to find the values:
  - SRCH_EQ- equal to set value
  - SRCH_NE - different from the set value
  - SRCH_GT - greater than set value
  - SRCH_LT - less than the set value
  - SRCH_GE - greater/ equal to s.v.
  - SRCH_LE - less/ equal to s.v.

**ARRAY_MOVE block diagram:**

**SRCH_EQ block diagram:**

## Conversion functions
**BCD-4 (INT) block diagram:**

![image](https://github.com/jwszol-classes/programmable-logic-controllers---ebook-jwszolek/assets/106549878/e3031e55-4980-4484-a08c-efbb1d5faff1)

BCD-4 function block is used to replace data stored as a signed integer with the same number but in the BCD-4 code. Input data do not change as a result of the function -> BCD-4. Furthermore, output data of this block can be directly applied as input parameters of other function blocks in the control program. 

This data conversion can be realised in order to connect a BCD-coded decimal numeric LED display or to send control codes to other external devices, such as high-frequency counters.

Signal arriving to a function block causes that a setpoint provided by the parameter IN is converted and its result is accessible through Q parameter. Output signal is transmitted when the function block receives output signal, unless the value of Q parameter after conversion exceeds the range of 0 to 9999.

**Parameters and its descriptions:**
- enable - input signal, conversion is performed when the function block receives a signal
- IN - contains constant value or variable address whose value undergoes conversion to a BCD-4 code
- ok - output signal appearing after arrival of input signal to function block and conversion without exceeding permissible range of values
- Q - contains the value of input parameter IN after conversion

**INT (BCD-4) block diagram:**

INT function block is used to replace data stored as a BCD-4 code with the same number but as a signed integer. Input data do not change as a result of the function -> INT. Furthermore, output data of this block can be directly applied as input parameters of other function blocks in the control program. 

Signal arriving to a function block causes that a setpoint provided by the parameter IN is converted and its result is accessible through Q parameter. Output signal is transmitted when the function block receives output signal, unless data exceed the permissible value range.

**Parameters and its descriptions:**
- enable - input signal, conversion is performed when the function block receives a signal
- IN - contains constant value or variable address whose value undergoes conversion to an INT number
- ok - output signal appearing after arrival of input signal to function block and conversion without exceeding permissible range of values
- Q - contains the value of input parameter IN after conversion

## Control functions
Control functions in programming logical controllers, specifically in the context of PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), are essential components that enable engineers and automation professionals to design and execute precise control logic for various industrial processes and systems. These functions serve as the building blocks of logic within PLC programs and play a critical role in governing the behaviour of the controller. We can distinguish the following functional blocks:
1. **CALL** 

The CALL function block allows you to call a procedure at a given point in the control program. When an input signal is received by a CALL function block, it immediately calls the desired procedure and completes its execution, and then returns the signal to the point immediately following the CALL block.

2. **DOIO**

The DOIO function block is used to immediately update the state of selected inputs or outputs during program execution, during the controller's work cycle. 
By using variables assigned to the controller inputs, the DOIO function allows the control program to use the latest values read from the physical inputs. However, if the given parameters are variables assigned to the outputs, the DOIO function uses the latest values saved in the controller memory by other logical elements of the control program.

When an input signal flows to the function block, the block parameters specify the inputs whose status is to be updated, and the set of inputs with the starting address ST and the ending address END is reviewed.

Further operation of the function depends on whether the ALT parameter (address) is used in the function block. If the ALT parameter is not present, the actual values of variables assigned to the scanned inputs are updated (i.e. %I or %AI). If the address is entered as the ALT parameter, the variable values are updated in the controller memory, starting from the address specified using the alt parameter (this may be, for example, the memory area assigned to %M or %R variables). If there are discrete variables as ST and END parameters, the alt parameter must also be a discrete variable, similarly in the case of registered variables.

When an input signal flows to the function block and the outputs whose status is to be updated are specified using the block parameters, the values of variables assigned to the output block with the starting address ST and the ending address END are sent to the output modules.
If there is no alt parameter in the DOIO function block, the values sent are read from the memory area assigned to %Q or %AQ variables.
If values from another memory area are to be sent to the controller outputs, the initial address of this area must be provided using the ALT parameter. The values from this area are then sent to the set of outputs addressed by the ST parameters and the DOIO function is used until all specified inputs or outputs are served. After executing this function, the control program moves to the next instruction.

The DOIO function block sends an output signal whenever it receives an input signal, unless one of the following occurs:
- Not all variables of the specified type from the given memory area are physically realisable (e.g. the input and output module is missing)
- The controller's central unit is unable to perform the function

![image](https://github.com/jwszol-classes/programmable-logic-controllers---ebook-jwszolek/assets/106549878/6bfae4bb-baa9-40e2-8611-e3ab58339f5f)

3. **END**

The END function block interrupts the execution of the logical part of the program. It does not have any additional parameters.
This block must be the last element at the program level. After encountering this element, the input signal will be redirected to the beginning of the program and will begin its execution in the next controller cycle. This function is also used at the beginning of the program to detect errors

4. **JUMP**

The JUMP function block skips the part of the logical part of the program located between JUMP and LABEL. When an input signal is received to the JUMP function block, all its relays contained in the mentioned area maintain their original state.

5. **LABEL**

The LABEL function block marks the jump destination and causes normal program execution to continue from that label. This block has no parameters or symbol, apart from the label itself, which is a sequence of alphanumeric characters. There cannot be two identical labels in the control program. A program in which JUMP and LABEL are not paired will also fail
