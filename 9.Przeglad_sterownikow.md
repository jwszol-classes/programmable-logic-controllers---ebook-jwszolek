- distributed installations as data collection systems 

### In distributed systems  

The built-in serial port allows you to connect a radio modem or GSM modem (devices enabling remote communication and sending collected data to superior control systems) 

### Communication  

The RS232 serial port built into the VersaMax Nano controller enables operation of simple devices such as scanners, scales or magnetic card readers using the Series I/O protocol. 

### Simple programming and setting 

The smallest family of GE Intelligent Platforms controllers is programmed using Proficy Machine Edition in LAD or Derived List format with functions known from Control class controllers. 

- advanced programming features such as a built-in high-speed counter function,  

- Support for mathematical functions, floating-point operations, procedures, and a general PID controller allows you to learn programming, which will later be made available to administrators. 

### Built-in signal handling 

The Nano series has built-in support for discrete I/O signals and can be equipped with one analog voltage input. Input and channel diagnostics are provided by means of connected LED drivers, which facilitates and speeds up the service of devices. 

#### VersaMax Nano PLCs feature: 

▪ Two non-removable recessed “box-style” terminal strips  

▪ An external Run/Stop switch can be wired to the Nano PLC. The switch can be configured as a run/stop switch, or a memory protect switch, and used for clearing faults when a fatal fault exists  

▪ Configurable to read configuration at power-up from either RAM or flash memory (ROM). Can also be configured to read application program from flash at power-up  

▪ Capacitor backs up RAM for at least 30 minutes on hardware revisions C or above 

▪ Full-featured programming Instruction Set with floating point math 

▪ 2K words of program memory, 256 words of registers 

▪ built-in RS232 serial port  

▪ local diagnostics using LEDs

## PACSystems RX3i controllers are solutions designed for the automation of medium and large-scale control systems. These systems not only handle a large number of I/O signals but also demand extensive functionality, rich communication capabilities, and high reliability.

The advantage of the RX3i system over other solutions in the market is primarily its flexible, open, and fully scalable architecture. Powerful central processing units enable rapid execution of algorithms for discrete, analog, and motion control. One significant benefit of this series is the mounting racks equipped with two buses, allowing the installation of modules dedicated to RX3i as well as modules from the 90-30 controllers. This facilitates migration from older solutions to modern systems, utilizing existing module inventory and significantly reducing costs.

Using the PACSystems RX3i series, it's possible to build redundant, high-availability systems with seamless control switching for applications where unplanned downtime results in significant financial losses, poses risks to human life and health, or threatens the natural environment.

The RX3i system comes with the most powerful processor among systems in its class available on the market, resulting in high data processing speed and improved system performance. Programming, servicing, and system expansion can be carried out on the fly using the Test Mode function, which allows for quick reversion to the last stable version of the program if any introduced changes cause instability.
