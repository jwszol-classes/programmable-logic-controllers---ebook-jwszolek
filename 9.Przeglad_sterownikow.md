CompactLogix™ controller provides higher performance, increased capacity, improved productivity and enhanced security to help meet the growing demands of smart machines and equipment for manufacturing. These controllers use a common easy-to-use development environment. Tight integration between the programming software, controller and I/O modules reduces development time and cost at commissioning and during normal operation. This commonality provides cost-effective integration of a machine or safety application into a plant-wide control system because it integrates safety, motion, discrete and drive capabilities in one controller.

### Overview:

- Provides a Logix based real-time controller that runs an instance of Windows 10 IoT Enterprise

- Supported in Studio 5000 Logix Designer® version 32

- Is ideal for mid-size to large applications requiring high performance control and data throughput

- Enables high-speed I/O, motion control, and Device Level Ring/Linear topologies

- Includes three GbE Ethernet/IP ports that enable high-speed communications, I/O, and motion control (two are configurable, and support Dual IP address or Device Level Ring)

- Includes one GbE Ethernet port as a dedicated commercial OS network interface

- Supports up to 31 local Bulletin 5069 Compact I/O™ modules

- Offers enhanced security features that include digitally-signed controller firmware, controller-based change detection, and a log of role-based access control to routines and Add-On instructions

- Allows users to deploy Windows 10 based off the shelf and/or custom applications while tightly integrated with real time Logix control

- Includes integrated DisplayPort for high definition industrial monitor connectivity

- Includes two USB 3.0 ports for OS peripheral and expanded data storage capability

### Integrated Safety:

Certain models offer integrated safety functionality for applications that require safety features like emergency stops and safety interlocks.
