**The VersaMax Micro Series** represents a family of PLC controllers offered by Emerson Industrial Automation & Controls. This family consists of 26 distinct models, each designed to cater to small and medium-sized control systems. These controllers are adept at communication with other automation systems and are capable of managing anywhere from just a few to as many as hundreds of I/O signals. With their compact design, extensive functionality, and user-friendly interface, these controllers have found their niche in applications involving simple machinery as well as distributed control systems.

#### Flexible Communication Options:
- RS232
- RS485
- Ethernet (supporting Modbus TCP Client/Server and SRTP protocols)
- USB

#### Scalability:
The VersaMax Micro controllers have been engineered to accommodate up to 4 additional expansion modules, allowing a single system to support a maximum of 320 I/O signals.

#### Support for Drive Systems:
These controllers come equipped with built-in support for High-Speed Counter (HSC) signals, capable of handling frequencies up to 100kHz, and offer Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) output at 65kHz. This makes them suitable for controlling stepper motors, and they can also manage up to 4 VersaMotion servo drives.

#### Motion Programming:
Certain models within the VersaMax Micro Plus series are armed with 48kB of RAM and Flash memory, enabling the creation of intricate control programs comprising thousands of rungs. The programming can be executed using either Machine Edition Lite or Professional Suite, with the added convenience of being able to upload programs on the fly.

#### Continuous Operation:
All VersaMax Micro PLCs are equipped with both RAM and Flash memory. The Micro Plus models with 48kB of dedicated program memory allow for program updates and configuration changes without the need to halt the controller's operation. This feature is particularly invaluable in scenarios where uninterrupted operation is critical.

#### Support for Analog Inputs:
The VersaMax Micro controllers can be expanded with 4 additional expansion modules that facilitate the management of both discrete and analog signals. These modules include configurable channels for measuring current and voltage, complete with 12-bit signal converters. Additionally, they are capable of handling signals from thermocouples and resistive sensors.

#### Enhanced Precision and Control:
With built-in support for 32-bit counters offering 32-bit resolution, the controllers provide superior precision in controlling drive systems and advanced pulse sensors. These controllers can process HSC inputs with frequencies of up to 100kHz and control PWM signals up to 65kHz.

#### Efficient Servicing and Application Transfer:
The design of VersaMax Micro controllers permits the swift disconnection of connection terminals without the need to disconnect signal cables. This streamlined approach expedites servicing. Moreover, VersaMax Micro Plus models can be fitted with an optional Flash memory module, facilitating program updates without relying on a PC. This reduces downtime and minimizes service costs.

#### Seamless Communication:
The VersaMax Micro Series controllers are equipped with multiple built-in communication ports, encompassing RS232, RS485, Ethernet, and USB. They support an array of communication protocols, including SNPX, Modbus RTU, Serial ASCII, Modbus TCP, SRTP, and more. This flexibility ensures a seamless integration with diverse automation systems.

#### Integration with Remote I/O Systems:
Controllers equipped with optional Ethernet communication ports are capable of gathering data from remote I/O systems, such as VersaMax I/O, utilizing the Modbus TCP protocol.

#### Integration and Advanced Servo Control:
Thanks to their dual independent communication ports, VersaMax Micro controllers can seamlessly integrate multiple automation solutions from different manufacturers. Supported communication protocols encompass Modbus RTU, Modbus TCP, SNP/SNPX, SRTP, and ASCII. Furthermore, servo drive control is achievable with 20, 40, and 64-point units featuring transistor outputs.

#### Versatile Applications:
VersaMax Micro controllers find applications across diverse industrial sectors, including factory automation, machinery control, process monitoring, HVAC systems (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), and more.

### Application Flexibility and Scalability:
VersaMax Micro PLCs offer the flexibility and scalability required to address a wide range of applications. Whether you need more I/O for certain applications (up to four modules can be added) or prefer using them as standalone controllers for smaller machinery with integrated I/O functions, VersaMax Micro PLCs allow you to configure a solution tailored to your precise requirements and budget.

### Remarkable Features in a Compact Package:
The small-footprint VersaMax Micro PLCs are built on a modular design and come with various built-in features. These include support for up to 64 I/O points (expandable to 176 I/O points), swift cycle times, a robust instruction set, and expansive memory that enhances your programming options.

### A Wide Array of Communication Possibilities:
All units feature an RS-232 port, suitable for SNP slave, Modbus RTU, or serial I/O commands. Certain models also include an RS-485 port, providing capabilities for SNP master and Modbus master commands. In the case of the Micro 20, Micro 40, and Micro 64 models, they offer a second option port that can accommodate RS-232, RS-485, or USB communication modules. Effortless networking to Ethernet is made possible through the potent VersaMax SE (Serial to Ethernet module).

### Enhancing Productivity through Performance:
The VersaMax Micro family combines the power and performance of customized solutions with the convenience and economy of off-the-shelf technology. VersaMax Micro PLCs have two channels of high-speed control, two independent 65kHz pulse and direction outputs, and user-configurable inputs and outputs to effectively increase machine performance. With VersaMax Micro PLCs, you can reduce costs and save time on machine configurations without compromising the ability to customize the features that are right for your application.
